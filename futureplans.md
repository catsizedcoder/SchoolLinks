## This file details future plans/ideas for the site.

1. Remove Broken Games.

2. Add More Games.

3.  Add A Dedicated Site Chatroom.

4.  Make An Unblocker Section.

5.  Make The UI/UX Better.

6.  Make The Site More Optimized By Minimizing/Simplifying The Old Code.

7. Make A Dynamic Game Page that loads games based on URL query params (Ex: /game?1v1.lol Or /p?jellytruck)
This would speed up production as pages wouldn't be regenerated.

8. Fix Sitemap.

9. Get A Custom Domain.

10. Make A better readme.md.

11. Make it so all hyperlinks are highlighted by default and just use a diff class for no highlight.

12. Make Daily secret use an api instead of manual commits.

13. Move Games/Thumbnails to a seperate repository in order to speed up deploy times.

14. Make a vercel quick deploy option

15. Add Gzip Compression to site and its assets

16. Make pages build dynamically via each commit/on runtime to save space (likely will tie in after/with #7)
