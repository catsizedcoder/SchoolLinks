## This file details future plans/ideas for the site.

1. Remove Broken Games.

2. Add More Games.

3.  ~Add A Dedicated Site Chatroom.~ (Swapped to using discord for now)

4.  Make An Unblocker Section. (Likely will be links to unblockers)

5.  Make The UI/UX Better. (coming mid v3 or in v4)

6.  Make The Site More Optimized By Minimizing/Simplifying The Old Code.

7. Make A Dynamic Game Page that loads games based on URL query params (Ex: /game?1v1.lol Or /p?jellytruck) This would speed up production as there wouldn't be a need for 200+ pages being generated every time a game is added.

8. Make a script to dynamically build a Sitemap.

9. Get A Custom Domain instead of the current subdomain setup

10. Revamp the README.md.

11. Make it so all hyperlinks are highlighted by default and just use a different class for no highlight.

12. Make Daily ____ section that uses an api instead of manual commits.

13. Move Games/Thumbnails to a seperate repository in order to speed up deploy times.

14. Make a vercel quick deploy option

15. Make pages build dynamically via each commit/on runtime to save space (likely will tie in after/with #7)
