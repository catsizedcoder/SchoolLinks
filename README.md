  An open-source unblocked games website based on <a href="https://github.com/mathgames66/mathgames66.github.io">MathGames66</a> with freedom in mind.
</p>

### Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnonymousElixir/SchoolLinks.git
cd SchoolLinks
python3 -m http.server
```

### Production

You should use a better static site server such as [NGINX](https://nginx.org/) or [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/), but It can run on [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) and [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) (which it currently runs on) with a much more simple workflow
